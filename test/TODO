### LATER
    re-rendering on window resize
    physical device - add more getters

### SOON
    add extension methods manually to header files
        or add check box to include them dynamically
            might need some structures along with it, like x11 window, windows window handle etc.

### NOW
    move objects to mgvulkanutilities

    try to simplify work with staging buffer - could be used in extended oop objects
    separate image/buffer and memory ??? - could be used in extended oop objects

    resource management
        wait for queue before its destruction
        wait for device before its detruction
        wait for device or queue before command/command buffer destruction ???
        wait for device or queue before other objects destruction ???????
            or could somehow record if they are being used, but that might be complicated
        wrap resource close with once

    oop object handles
        device
        image (+ inheritance based on image type or its usage, ie attachment, texture, ... ??? or add as extended oop objects)
        image view
        pipeline
        render pass
        ...

    extended oop objects ???
        framebuffer with images
        vertex array


### DONE
