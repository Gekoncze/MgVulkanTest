change test
    1) window and renderer classes
    2) re-rendering on window resize
    3) separate logging

move objects to mgvulkanutilities
    final decision: make only oop handles!

    try to simplify work with staging buffer
    separate image/buffer and memory ???

    wait for queue before its destruction
    wait for device before its detruction
    wait for device or queue before command/command buffer destruction ???

    wrap resource close with once

    objects
        separate image and image view ???
        vertex array ???
        pipeline
        render pass
        ...

    physical device - add more getters

add extension methods manually to header files
    or add check box to include them dynamically
        might need some structures along with it, like x11 window, windows window handle etc.

### DONE
added few more objects
    simplified objects architecture
    creating oop objects only for handles
    added more todo info
